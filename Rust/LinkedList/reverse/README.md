# Reverse a singly linked list

[solution1](solution1.md)

[solution2](solution1.md)

Given the pointer/reference to the head of a singly linked list (SLL), reverse it and return the pointer/reference to the head of reversed SLL

## Example
Consider the following SLL:
```
(head)->[7]->[14]->[21]->[28]->[NULL]
```

Return the pointer to a reversed SLL as shown below:
```
(head)->[28]->[21]->[14]->[7]->[NULL]
```

1. How would you do it iteratively in a single pass?
2. How would you do it recursively in a single pass?
